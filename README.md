# TeamUp - Discord Event Bot

### The bot is temporarily unavailable

A simple Discord bot to organize events on your server. Users can create events, join them, and confirm their readiness. The event will start when all participants are ready or the required number of participants is reached.

## Features
- Create events with a required number of participants.
- Users can join, leave, and confirm readiness.
- When all participants confirm their readiness, everyone receives a notification about the meeting place (the name of the voice channel).
- If time expires or the required participants arenâ€™t met, the event is canceled.
